## mat-php: Matchisuru web app project in PHP, for KSU Agile SWE class

#### Simple concept: Tinder for gamers.
Our users want to match with other gamers based on their preferences. They sign up and take a personality/general preferences quiz. Then, each time the user wants to find matches for a specific game, they take a game-specific quiz and we render a list of gamers ranked by their compatibility. The user can then send a friend request or message the other user, so they can arrange a date... to play video games.
